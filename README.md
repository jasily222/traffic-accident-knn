# Predicting Traffic Accident Severity using KNN

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how traffic accident severity can be predicted using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model. The model was built in Python using a subset of the US Accidents dataset (2016–2023) from Kaggle.

## 🧠 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the severity of traffic accidents based on weather-related and numeric features such as:
- Distance
- Visibility
- Wind Speed
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Precipitation

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Kaggle dataset
- GitHub for version control

## ⚙️ Methodology
- Cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of 7.7 million records
- Feature selection and handling missing data
- Used train-test split (80/20)
- Tuned the K value using an elbow method
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, and recall

## 🔍 Results
- Accuracy: **86.7%**
- Precision: **79%**
- Recall: **86.7%**
- Top contributing features: Visibility (0.225), Distance (0.123)

## 📁 Files Included
- [`TRAFFIC ACCIDENT KNN.ipynb`](./ITSS_4382_GP_FINAL.ipynb): Complete Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- [`Traffic Accident Severity Using KNN - Jasmine Ly.pdf`](./Traffic%20Accident%20Severity%20Using%20KNN%20-%20Jasmine%20Ly.pdf): Presentation slides summarizing the project.

## ✨ Lessons Learned
- Importance of data preprocessing and quality
- Limitations of KNN on large-scale, high-dimensional data
- Value of hyperparameter tuning

## 📢 Impact
Demonstrated how predictive analytics can be applied to real-world problems to inform public policy and emergency response strategies.
